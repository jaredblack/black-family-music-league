Some years ago 
Never mind how long precisely
But it was a cold Tuesday morning
I found a mysterious Amazon package

Inside?
New shoes!
I put them on and suddenly everything's right
I could walk, run, dance forever, never tiring

I made my way to the kitchen
Found all of my friends dancing
One of them, Squeaky Clean Joe, says
Wander through these streets
Where bright lights and angels meet
Walk on to the break of dawn
At Wegmans, find a personality to go along with your new shoes",072d0be9e43f488687579bf4a4afee3c,Yes

ROAR
